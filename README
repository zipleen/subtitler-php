Subtitler for Apache in PHP
---------------------------

This is a little PHP project that I built to do a specific purpose: write
the .srt files to the respective folder, from a website.

I had a crude version of this with some simple command lines, but I decide
to complicate this ten fold because of two things:
- write a simple OO PHP project to teach OO programming
- to teach simple HTML / JS / CSS to my brother

This became extinct when the subtitles downloader for XBMC started to work
for my sites, but it's still usefull when that doesn't work.

Sorry for the portuguese comments in the log, i'm trying to play with
svn2git =)
